We try to maintain a bi-monthly release cycle with Dragonfly. A new release is drafted at the end/start of every two months. We attach milestones to issues on the issue tracker to mark roughly in what release we expect to have the issue resolved. Note that we do not currently make a promise of preserving backwards compatibility. API might break, although we do try to minimise breaking changes. We'll always notify you of significant breaking changes on our Discord, so you can update easily.
